        <h3> coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease.
            A coronavirus
            identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.</h3>

                <font color=white>How does the coronavirus spread?</font>
            </h2>
        </li>
        <h3>As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released
            into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may
            fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in
            indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why
            mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.</h3>

            <h2>
                <font color=white>How did the coronavirus start?</font>
            </h2>
        </li>
        <h3>The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a then-new coronavirus later named
            SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in
            humans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks have been traced to viruses originating in birds,
            pigs, bats and other animals that mutated to become dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study
            may reveal how and why the coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.</h3>

            <h2>
                <font color=white>How is COVID-19 treated?</font>
            </h2>
        </li>
        <h3>Treatment for COVID-19 addresses the signs and symptoms of the infection and supports people with more
            severe disease. For mild cases of coronavirus disease, your doctor may recommend measures such as fever
            reducers or over-the-counter medications. More severe cases may require hospital care, where a patient may
            receive a combination of treatments that could include steroids, oxygen, mechanical breathing support and
            other COVID-19 treatments in development. Infusions of monoclonal antibodies given to certain patients early
            in the infection may reduce the symptoms, severity and duration of the illness.</h3>

        <h3>Vaccines are now authorized to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But
            until more is understood about how the vaccines affect a person’s ability to transmit the virus, precautions
            such as mask-wearing, physical distancing and hand hygiene should continue regardless of a person’s
            vaccination status to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine and ways to
            protect yourself.</h3>
